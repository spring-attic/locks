/**
 * Strategy interface for server side implementations of a global lock. Implementations
 * could be hopefully made for any back end that supports locks with these semantics. A
 * lock is identified by name which is globally unique, i.e. there can be only one holder
 * of the lock at a given time. Locks expire (in a way to be determined by the
 * implementation), and have a String value (usually random) which is used by the lock
 * holder to prove that he holds the lock. The value is thus unique per lock and per
 * expiry period (i.e. 2 locks held at different times with the same name will have
 * different values)..
